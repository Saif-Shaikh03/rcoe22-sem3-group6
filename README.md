# CADERNO (NOTES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)

> **Abstract** : We are creating a mobile application, named caderno. It is a notes management system based application, through this application students of collaborating universities can login through their official email id and view/manage their notes and also notes approved by teachers and professors. Students can also view previous year papers take part in weekly quizzes and daily wordle and are able to test their aptitude skills. Users get notifications about their exam schedule and syllabus a week before examination starts, they can also view previous year papers during this time. Users can also post their queries and get answers by the community. We are also going to use fingerprint sensors of your devices to get authentication for login (Iot).
